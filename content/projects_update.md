It is long overdue, but I have finally updated the projects page on this site. It provides a short summary of all the things I like to be nerdy about outside of the workplace.

From my home automation pursuits to the telepresence robot I made for school, I have given each project a short blurb and some photos, along with the associated link if one exists.

If you have any questions about any of these projects, feel free to contact me! I always love to explain how I solved a particular problem or came across a certain idea.
